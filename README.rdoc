== Sit Swap

Sit Swap is a web application created to connect Pet Owners to swap pet sitting services for each other. Users create a free profile, can search postings in their area, and contact other Users via the site.

This web application was created for a group project in a Ruby on Rails bootcamp and is a work in progress. Watch for it on Heroku! We will post the URL in the future.
